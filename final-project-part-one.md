# We all can read...then why don't we? Let's pick a book today!
## Background 

This topic started with me noticing that I do not read as much as I used to when I was younger. That made me think why that has been. Of course, I have more responsibilities now, as I am finishing up graduate school. Before that, I was a working professional for 3 years. "Not having the time to read" is a valid answer if someone asks me, but I think another culprit in this equation is the effect social media has had on my life in terms of hogging my attention. 

Here's my weekly average Instagram (my most used social media application) usage:

This shows that I spend an average of 100 minutes on Instagram daily, which is 36,500 minutes per year. Which is alarming on its own. 

Retrospectively, I mapped out how many books I have read since I was 16 years old. Here's the graph:

This shows I personally have read less as I have aged. 

Simple math here:

If I remember correctly, it used to take me around 600 minutes to read a 300-page book. Therefore, in 36500 minutes that I spend on Instagram, I should have read close to 60 books. And this is just Instagram. There are other apps that I use as well. Even if I am being generous to myself and considering I won't spend all my free time on reading, I should have read at least 15 books, but I just read 3. It won't be wrong to point out that the time I spend on social media has affected my attention, and there is a correlation between reading and social media usage. 

## Project Outline 

My aim with this story is to see whether similar trends emerge in more number of people between the ages of 16 and 35. It would be interesting to see how reading habits in late teens and adults are affected by the present boom in social media and clever content that is curated in a way that keeps you hooked on the web of likes, shares, and scrolling. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
