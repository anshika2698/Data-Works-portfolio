# We all can read...then why don't we? Let's pick a book today!
## Background 

This topic started with me noticing that I do not read as much as I used to when I was younger. That made me think why that has been. Of course, I have more responsibilities now, as I am finishing up graduate school. Before that, I was a working professional for 3 years. "Not having the time to read" is a valid answer if someone asks me, but I think another culprit in this equation is the effect social media has had on my life in terms of hogging my attention. 

Here's my weekly average Instagram (my most used social media application) usage:

This shows that I spend an average of 100 minutes on Instagram daily, which is 36,500 minutes per year. Which is alarming on its own. 

Retrospectively, I mapped out how many books I have read since I was 16 years old. Here's the graph:

This shows I personally have read less as I have aged. 

Simple math here:

If I remember correctly, it used to take me around 600 minutes to read a 300-page book. Therefore, in 36500 minutes that I spend on Instagram, I should have read close to 60 books. And this is just Instagram. There are other apps that I use as well. Even if I am being generous to myself and considering I won't spend all my free time on reading, I should have read at least 15 books, but I just read 3. It won't be wrong to point out that the time I spend on social media has affected my attention, and there is a correlation between reading and social media usage. 

## Project Outline 

My aim with this story is to explore whether similar patterns appear among a larger group of people between the ages of 16 and 35. I want to understand how reading habits in late teens and adults are shaped by the current boom in social media and the clever, attention-grabbing content designed to keep us scrolling.

It would also be valuable to see how people maintain their reading routines today. The rising popularity of audiobooks and e-books compared to physical books may reveal how the medium influences the amount of reading we actually do.

Finally, I hope to examine which social media platforms are most popular and how each one triggers different emotions to keep users engaged. The functionality and sentiment behind these applications often determine how, and how much, we interact with them.

User Story: 

As a person aged between 16–35, I want to balance my social media use with reading so that I can gain knowledge and form my own ideas directly rather than passively consuming curated content.

## Initial sketches

My story starts with the background of this idea, as shown above, and then dives into finding whether this trend holds up with a larger set of people or not. 

The very first step is to visualize the data that shows the number of books read between the ages of 16 and 35, along with the time spent on social media among this age bracket

Now, to be comprehensive, it would be beneficial to see how people are interacting with other media of reading audiobooks or e-books instead of physical books. This will help us better estimate the current pattern of reading among individuals.

To get into the details of social media usage. It would be important to see which platforms are most dominant among the targeted age group, as this would help us understand where attention is being spent.

Finally, it would be interesting to see how these platforms interact with users and keep them engaged by curating experiences and content that evoke emotions such as happiness, fuel anxieties, etc., which makes users spend more time on the platform than they initially intended to. Therefore, the "doom scrolls" or going into "rabbit holes" is very common.

Another way of depicting the same information could be a heat map, like the sketch below
