# User Research 

## Target Audience

People in the 25–30 age range occupy a unique and transitional stage of life. They are typically early in their careers, juggling increasing professional responsibilities while still navigating personal identity, relationships, and lifestyle choices. This demographic is also one of the most digitally immersed, having grown up during the rise of smartphones, social media, and constant online connectivity.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand how users emotionally experience the story and connect with it | What part of the story made you feel the strongest reaction? Why?, Did the narrative resonate with your experience?, Did anything feel confusing, overwhelming, or hard to connect to emotionally? |
| Assess how users interpret and understand the data visualisations |  Which visualization was the easiest to understand? Why?, Which one confused the most?, Were you able to understand the emotion bubble chart at a glance? |
| Get insights on whether the narrative flows smoothly from section to section | Did the story feel cohesive and connected as you scrolled?,  Was there any point where you felt lost or unsure why a section was included?, Where did your attention peak and dip throughout the story? |
| Understand what actions or changes the story motivates | After reading, do you feel motivated to change your social media habits? Why or why not?, Would you consider setting boundaries or tracking your usage more consciously?, What would help you take concrete next steps? |
| To understand what works and doesn't for the design| Did you like the theme?, How did the color scheme work for you?, Did the background images become overwhelming at any time? |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 | Interview 4 | Interview 5 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Did the narrative resonate with your experience?| Really liked the snappy title, peaks interest and makes people want to read further | The title felt "attacking" as they could relate to it too much and made them reflect on their usage| The overall narrative was very interesting they did not ever realise to look at reading books from the lens of social media affecting it | The narrative captured a tension they often felt wanting to read more but instinctively reaching for Instagram or Twitter because they’re emotionally stimulating and easy to access |They found the narrative resonating but were also aware of the fact that some of the age-group differences felt less directly relatable because everyone in their circle uses social media differently|
| Did anything feel confusing, overwhelming, or hard to connect to emotionally? | No, they found the story very relatable and easy to follow | The personal data that I mentioned on one of the pages was mistaken by them as some facts taken off the internet, which I had to clarify to them later in our discussion | Overall it was clear, but they got slightly confused during the transition from age-group data to platform-specific emotional analysis. They understood both sections individually, but the jump felt a bit abrupt | The visuals were easy to interpret, but they found the emotional reactions chart a bit dense at first glance | Emotionally, they connected with the content, but they weren't sure whose perspective the emotional data represented: mine, a larger sample, or general research findings |
| Which visualisation was the easiest to understand? Why? |                                |             |             |
| Which one confused the most?||| 
| Did the background images become overwhelming at any time?| | | | | |
| After reading, do you feel motivated to change your social media habits? Why or why not? |

## AI acknowledgements
I also want to acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot in helping me structure my ideas more coherently and helping me ideate over several questions that I could ask to make the most out of my user interviews.
