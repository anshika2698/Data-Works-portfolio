# About me
I believe making the best out of the opportunities you fall upon is a skill known to many but mastered by none. 
Reflecting upon my journey, I have been honing this skill throughout my career and ultimately found that I want to make an impact in the Healthcare space and work at the intersection of Technology and Business. 

My professional journey began when I started to work as an Associate Software Engineer in the US healthcare space at Carelon Global Solutions. I primarily focused on the healthcare procedure preauthorization process improvement. Making accessing healthcare easy and less time-consuming for patients. I worked extensively with various types of healthcare data and technologies to provide the best support for this objective. 

As a next step to further improve my understanding of the processes and policies revolving around the Healthcare industry, I am pursuing a Master's in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology (MSHCA) at Carnegie Mellon University - Heinz College. My passion lies in leveraging business strategy, technology, and data to drive improvements in healthcare systems. I want to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare processes by leveraging my business acumen, technical skills, and analytical expertise to deliver innovative solutions.

Digressing a little from my professional pursuits, I also enjoy reading and journaling. I find it calming and is my go-to activity to relax and gain perspective. 

If you're interested in healthcare transformation or in discussions involving innovative approaches to improve healthcare systems, I’d love to connect! Whether it’s sharing insights on healthcare technology or simply recommending a great book for me to muse upon. I’m always open to engaging in meaningful conversations. Please feel free to reach out, I’d be excited to explore ideas together!

or...
