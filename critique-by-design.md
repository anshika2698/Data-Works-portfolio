I chose this data because the topic of global migration by religious affiliation is inherently fascinating and highly relevant in today’s world. Migration is often discussed through economic or political lenses, but looking at it through the lens of religion reveals a different layer of global movement and interconnectedness. It highlights how cultural identities travel, how communities shift across borders, and how religious groups are distributed internationally. This perspective adds depth to our understanding of migration patterns and prompts questions about the social, historical, and geopolitical forces that shape them.

What makes this information particularly compelling is the way it challenges some common assumptions. Many people don’t typically think of migration in terms of religion, yet these patterns reflect broader global dynamics like opportunity, diaspora, and demographic change. Seeing the relative sizes of different religious groups among migrants encourages deeper reflection on why certain populations move more than others and how these movements reshape societies. It’s a perspective that blends data with human stories, making it a meaningful and thought-provoking topic to explore. 

## Critique

Overall, the visualization presents interesting and insightful information, but it feels more complicated than necessary. The title highlights one key story—Christians as the largest migrant group—yet the chart contains many other narratives that aren’t aligned with that focus. This mismatch makes the purpose of the visualization feel unclear. Moreover, the notes section is q1uite long, which distracts from the main message and visually overwhelms the design.

Several structural and layout issues also weaken the clarity of the graphic. The source is placed at the bottom and blends into the notes, when it would be more effective and transparent if positioned near the top. If the emphasis is truly on Christians, the remaining bars could be visually de-emphasized, such as by using a grey color palette for the other groups. As it stands, the colors appear arbitrary rather than meaningful, reducing the sense of intentionality in the design.

Despite these challenges, some elements work well. The clear ordering from largest to smallest makes comparisons intuitive, and the dominant share of Christians is immediately obvious because of the longest bar. However, the color choices and framing of the title risk coming across as biased or leading. In summary, the visualization succeeds in conveying a key insight but suffers from design inconsistencies that affect focus, neutrality, and overall coherence.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What pops out in this visualization?  | The large share of Christians among global migrants stands out, but the visual is cluttered with colors and categories that compete for attention| The contrast between religiously affiliated and unaffiliated groups is noticeable, though the grey for unaffiliated could be stronger| The sheer volume of categories and colors pops out, but it’s visually overwhelming and the main message is not immediately clear
| What did you like?  | They liked that Christians were clearly the largest group it’s an interesting insight and very easy to interpret because the pie chart makes it so obvious| Simple pie chart made the proportions easier to understand than a complex bar graph | Appreciated the simplicity of the pie chart while still providing a detailed breakdown of multiple religions; it felt informative without being overwhelming
| What should I work upon as a priority?  | Simplify the color scheme and reduce contrast | Develop a clear story and an informative title that guides the audience | Group smaller categories so the key story stands out.

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
