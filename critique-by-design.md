I chose this data because the topic of global migration by religious affiliation is inherently fascinating and highly relevant in today’s world. Migration is often discussed through economic or political lenses, but looking at it through the lens of religion reveals a different layer of global movement and interconnectedness. It highlights how cultural identities travel, how communities shift across borders, and how religious groups are distributed internationally. This perspective adds depth to our understanding of migration patterns and prompts questions about the social, historical, and geopolitical forces that shape them.

What makes this information particularly compelling is the way it challenges some common assumptions. Many people don’t typically think of migration in terms of religion, yet these patterns reflect broader global dynamics like opportunity, diaspora, and demographic change. Seeing the relative sizes of different religious groups among migrants encourages deeper reflection on why certain populations move more than others and how these movements reshape societies. It’s a perspective that blends data with human stories, making it a meaningful and thought-provoking topic to explore. 

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
