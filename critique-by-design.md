I chose this data because the topic of global migration by religious affiliation is inherently fascinating and highly relevant in today’s world. Migration is often discussed through economic or political lenses, but looking at it through the lens of religion reveals a different layer of global movement and interconnectedness. It highlights how cultural identities travel, how communities shift across borders, and how religious groups are distributed internationally. This perspective adds depth to our understanding of migration patterns and prompts questions about the social, historical, and geopolitical forces that shape them.

What makes this information particularly compelling is the way it challenges some common assumptions. Many people don’t typically think of migration in terms of religion, yet these patterns reflect broader global dynamics like opportunity, diaspora, and demographic change. Seeing the relative sizes of different religious groups among migrants encourages deeper reflection on why certain populations move more than others and how these movements reshape societies. It’s a perspective that blends data with human stories, making it a meaningful and thought-provoking topic to explore. 

## Critique

Overall, the visualization presents interesting and insightful information, but it feels more complicated than necessary. The title highlights one key story—Christians as the largest migrant group—yet the chart contains many other narratives that aren’t aligned with that focus. This mismatch makes the purpose of the visualization feel unclear. Moreover, the notes section is q1uite long, which distracts from the main message and visually overwhelms the design.

Several structural and layout issues also weaken the clarity of the graphic. The source is placed at the bottom and blends into the notes, when it would be more effective and transparent if positioned near the top. If the emphasis is truly on Christians, the remaining bars could be visually de-emphasized, such as by using a grey color palette for the other groups. As it stands, the colors appear arbitrary rather than meaningful, reducing the sense of intentionality in the design.

Despite these challenges, some elements work well. The clear ordering from largest to smallest makes comparisons intuitive, and the dominant share of Christians is immediately obvious because of the longest bar. However, the color choices and framing of the title risk coming across as biased or leading. In summary, the visualization succeeds in conveying a key insight but suffers from design inconsistencies that affect focus, neutrality, and overall coherence.

## Step four: Test the solution

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What pops out in this visualization?  | The large share of Christians among global migrants stands out, but the visual is cluttered with colors and categories that compete for attention| The contrast between religiously affiliated and unaffiliated groups is noticeable, though the grey for unaffiliated could be stronger| The sheer volume of categories and colors pops out, but it’s visually overwhelming and the main message is not immediately clear
| What did you like?  | They liked that Christians were clearly the largest group. It’s an interesting insight and very easy to interpret because the pie chart makes it so obvious| Simple pie chart made the proportions easier to understand than a complex bar graph | Appreciated the simplicity of the pie chart while still providing a detailed breakdown of multiple religions; it felt informative without being overwhelming
| What should I work upon as a priority?  | Simplify the color scheme and reduce contrast | Develop a clear story and an informative title that guides the audience | Group smaller categories so the key story stands out.

Synthesis: 

Looking back at the feedback from the interviewers, a clear pattern started to emerge. Everyone seemed to agree that the pie chart itself is a strength—it’s simple, easy to interpret, and immediately shows that Christians make up the largest share of global migrants. I liked hearing that the simplicity helped people grasp the proportions quickly, and that the chart still manages to include a detailed breakdown of multiple religions without feeling overwhelming. Which was a concern of mine, have I simplified it too much? But I think I hit just the spot. At the same time, it was clear that the visual felt cluttered due to too many colors and categories competing for attention.

What really stood out to me from this feedback is how much story was missing in the visualization. I realized that a chart can be technically correct and still lose its audience if the story isn’t clear. Things like simplifying colors, grouping smaller categories, and using neutral tones for less central groups would go a long way toward clarity. I also saw the importance of an informative title and a headline that guides the viewer toward the insight. Moving forward, I want my redesign to keep the strengths of the pie chart—its simplicity and proportional clarity but make the story around it more compelling and understandable. It feels like a balance between being visually appealing and narratively clear, and that’s what I want to achieve in the final version.
