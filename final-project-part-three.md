# The final data story
Shorthand Story: [From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice](https://preview.shorthand.com/FSuLeGuMBl4jFkSt) 

# Changes and Design Decision made since Part II

Since part II, I have made quite a number of changes as suggested by my users. These changes range from cosmetic changes to story design changes. I also refined a couple of my visualisations as suggested by people.

<u> **The Title:** </u> People liked the title, but one person found the title too snappy which can be ignored, but as per math, when this website goes public, there is a good chance that 15-20% might feel attacked therefore I decided to change the tile from "We all can read, so why don’t we? Let’s pick a book today!" to "From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice" which delivered the sentiments in a more neutral and "makes you ponder" kinda way than making people feel judged.

I also want to acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot in helping me structure my ideas more coherently and help me polish the elements of the story that could benefit from adding more clarity in terms of text, data, and general insights.
