# The Audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

# Changes and Design Decisions made since Part II

Since part II, I have made quite a number of changes as suggested by my users. These changes range from cosmetic changes to story design changes. I also refined a couple of my visualisations as suggested by people.

**The Title:** <br>
People liked the title, but one person found the title too snappy which can be ignored, but as per math, when this website goes public, there is a good chance that 15-20% might feel attacked therefore I decided to change the tile from "We all can read, so why don’t we? Let’s pick a book today!" to "From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice" which delivered the sentiments in a more neutral and "makes you ponder" kinda way than making people feel judged. 

**Background Images:** <br>
The moodboard helped, and from the start, I knew I wanted bright colors and an edge to the website for two reasons. Firstly, the book covers come in every possible color you can think of and add to their charm and secondly social media is all about different styles, colors, and pictures coming together to keep the audience engaged, so it was quite "on brand" in my opinion. It was not as easy as I supposed it would be. Finding the right balance between the theme, tone, color, and contrast was a bit tricky to achieve. 

There were a few background images that resonated well with the content of that particular page, but did not match the theme of the website overall. So I had to replace them. Being too committed to a background image was not a good strategy, and being flexible in that sense helped me have a better overall theme and design for the website. The contrast was another issue. Some images were too bright and high contrast, which made the text placed on top of them way too overwhelming. Another decision I made was to use mellow shades of yellow and off white for the website. I did, however, sprinkle a few pastel colors here and there throughout the website. Finally, these strategies worked much better and aligned with my vision. 

**Visualizations:** <br>
Part II set me up quite well in terms of visualizations. Most of my visualizations stayed the same and turned out pretty good and feasible when I tried to implement them on Tableau. There was one visualization that I knew was tricky to keep simple, as well as showcase all the info that I wanted that visualization to show: the emotion trigger visualization. In part II, I suggested visualizing it using scatter plots. Which seemed less intuitive when I finally implemented it using Tableau. So I switched to using a bubble graph and was quite content with what I came up with. Restrospectively, I think it was because it was so much better than the scatter plot and made more sense to me. Unfortunately, it wasn't the most obvious one for the users.

Issues like it was hard to follow and interpret, too much eye movement, and not intuitive at first glance were reported by the users. It being a key component of the story, I finally decided to settle for the tabular bar chart. Using that, decluttered the visualization itself. It also made it easy to follow compared to the previous one. I made sure I used bar colors that were consistent with the color of the app logos so that it is easy to form that mental connection.

Lastly, with my pie chart, there were minor suggestions like having the labelling on the pie would make it easier to follow, which seemed valid and easy to do, and I incorporated that as well. 

**Call To Action:** <br>
I struggled with the call to action the most for mainly two reasons. Firstly, my data, while it had tangible information in various columns, was just hard to extract just the right bits that would fit in my story correctly, and that would eventually support a good call to action. Secondly, as a ripple effect of its previous problem, I had too many directions that could take this, and finding the one that sat right with me personally and did justice to the story was tricky.

Here, copiolet came in handy to brainstorm ideas and give me more directions. Suggesting "People should read more" seemed too broad, vague, and a lackluster call to action. That's where I formed idea to leverage the reading medium data and focus on the calm focus and instant hits trajectory. Where I appealed towards focusing on reducing the friction between reading and the quick usage of reading materials to make it the "easiest next option" instead of the hardest. 

# Additional Small Changes
- The "My Data" section had the time I spent on social media in minutes, which seemed less intuitive to people, so converting it into days made a difference, as that seemed more digestible and easy to estimate, and created a sense of urgency.
- To make my call to action more tangible and valid, I introduced an additional "How do we lower this friction?" section and suggested ways that can help in increasing reading and less time on social media, which made people think it is not just an idea but something that can be implemented easily in their day-to-day lives.
- Added a reference section on shorthand.

# Final Reflection

What excited me the most about this topic was to see if my intuition about the social media usage pattern was right. What that means is I was really interested in seeing how people my age are dealing with social media, are the patterns similar to mine? Using medians was very intentional and tactical for me. It clearly showed on what side of the spectrum people were, and where "I" was. To answer my question, I believe I was right in looking at the place. Establishing a correlation is a technical detail that I did not go into intentionally because the data was simply not enough, but it did give a faint idea about how the environment around us is getting just keep an eye out for these changes that creep into our lifestyle without us noticing. 

Initially, when I spoke to my peers about their process, they suggested finding good data first, then building your story around it. It seemed clever and for a bit a thought I should have done that, but Iam glad that I did not. I would not have put in this much effort into my project if it weren't a topic close to me. Even during the final presentations, I could see the difference when people chose a topic close to their heart and how beautifully everything came around it. 

Lastly, I do not have any regrets, but if I had more time, I would have tried to learn Tableau more thoroughly to leverage the power of visualizations better. I am still a little dissatisfied with the visualization that I finally landed on for the "Emotions & What's Triggering Them?" visualizations. If I had more time, I would have really liked to explore other graph types and see other possibilities to tweak them.

All in all, I personally feel good about the work that I have put forward with this project. It is authentic to me and resonates with my style and my strong sentiments around the topic that I choose.
