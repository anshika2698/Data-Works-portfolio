# The Audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

# Changes and Design Decisions made since Part II

Since part II, I have made quite a number of changes as suggested by my users. These changes range from cosmetic changes to story design changes. I also refined a couple of my visualisations as suggested by people.

**The Title:** <br>
People liked the title, but one person found the title too snappy which can be ignored, but as per math, when this website goes public, there is a good chance that 15-20% might feel attacked therefore I decided to change the tile from "We all can read, so why don’t we? Let’s pick a book today!" to "From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice" which delivered the sentiments in a more neutral and "makes you ponder" kinda way than making people feel judged. 

**Background Images:** <br>
The moodboard helped, and from the start, I knew I wanted bright colors and an edge to the website for two reasons. Firstly, the book covers come in every possible color you can think of and add to their charm and secondly social media is all about different styles, colors, and pictures coming together to keep the audience engaged, so it was quite "on brand" in my opinion. It was not as easy as I supposed it would be. Finding the right balance between the theme, tone, color, and contrast was a bit tricky to achieve. 

There were a few background images that resonated well with the content of that particular page, but did not match the theme of the website overall. So I had to replace them. Being too committed to a background image was not a good strategy, and being flexible in that sense helped me have a better overall theme and design for the website. The contrast was another issue. Some images were too bright and high contrast, which made the text placed on top of them way too overwhelming. Another decision I made was to use mellow shades of yellow and off white for the website. I did, however, sprinkle a few pastel colors here and there throughout the website. Finally, these strategies worked much better and aligned with my vision. 

**Visualizations:** <br>
Part II set me up quite well in terms of visualizations. Most of my visualizations stayed the same and turned out pretty good and feasible when I tried to implement them on Tableau. There was one visualization that I knew was tricky to keep simple, as well as showcase all the info that I wanted that visualization to show: the emotion trigger visualization. In part II, I suggested visualizing it using scatter plots. Which seemed less intuitive when I finally implemented it using Tableau. So I switched to using a bubble graph and was quite content with what I came up with. Restrospectively, I think it was because it was so much better than the scatter plot and made more sense to me. Unfortunately, it wasn't the most obvious one for the users.

Issues like it was hard to follow and interpret, too much eye movement, and not intuitive at first glance were reported by the users. It being a key component of the story, I finally decided to settle for the tabular bar chart. Using that, decluttered the visualization itself. It also made it easy to follow compared to the previous one. I made sure I used bar colors that were consistent with the color of the app logos so that it is easy to form that mental connection.

Lastly, with my pie chart, there were minor suggestions like having the labelling on the pie would make it easier to follow, which seemed valid and easy to do, and I incorporated that as well. 

**Call To Action:** <br>
I struggled with the most, I was conflicted on whether to

I also want to acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot in helping me structure my ideas more coherently and help me polish the elements of the story that could benefit from adding more clarity in terms of text, data, and general insights.
