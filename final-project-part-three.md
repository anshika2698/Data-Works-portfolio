# The final data story
Shorthand Story: [From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice](https://preview.shorthand.com/FSuLeGuMBl4jFkSt) 

# Changes and Design Decision made since Part II

Since part II, I have made quite a number of changes as suggested by my users. These changes range from cosmetic changes to story design changes. I also refined a couple of my visualisations as suggested by people.

**The Title:**
People liked the title, but one person found the title too snappy which can be ignored, but as per math, when this website goes public, there is a good chance that 15-20% might feel attacked therefore I decided to change the tile from "We all can read, so why don’t we? Let’s pick a book today!" to "From Novels to Nine-Second Reels: The Attention Swap We Didn’t Notice" which delivered the sentiments in a more neutral and "makes you ponder" kinda way than making people feel judged. 

**Background Images:** 
The moodboard helped, and from the start, I knew I wanted bright colors and an edge to the website for two reasons. Firstly, the book covers come in every possible color you can think of and add to their charm and secondly social media is all about different styles, colors, and pictures coming together to keep the audience engaged, so it was quite "on brand" in my opinion. It was not as easy as I supposed it would be. Finding the right balance between the theme, tone, color, and contrast was a bit tricky to achieve. 

There were a few background images that resonated well with the content of that particular page, but did not match the theme of the website overall. So I had to replace them. Being too committed to a background image was not a good strategy, and being flexible in that sense helped me have a better overall theme and design for the website. The contrast was another issue. Some images were too bright and high contrast, which made the text placed on top of them way too overwhelming. Another decision I made was to use mellow shades of yellow and off white for the website. I did, however, sprinkle a few pastel colors here and there throughout the website. Finally, these strategies worked much better and aligned with my vision. 

**Visualizations:**

**Call To Action:**

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
I also want to acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot in helping me structure my ideas more coherently and help me polish the elements of the story that could benefit from adding more clarity in terms of text, data, and general insights. 

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
